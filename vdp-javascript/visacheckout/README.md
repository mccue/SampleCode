To get started with Visa Checkout merchant APIs, you must have a transaction
identified by a <code>callId</code>, which is only available when the consumer clicks the
Visa Checkout button. Start with the sample in this folder to create a button
and obtain the <code>callId</code>. Note: You must have an API key to use the sample.
Your API key is the key that Visa supplies when you choose Create a Test App at
